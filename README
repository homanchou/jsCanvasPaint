jsCanvasPaint - jquery plugin that turns any canvas element into a simple painting, sketching area.

Usage:

$('#myCanvas').jsCanvasPaint();

Features:

Responds to both mouse events on desktop as well as touch events on mobile devices.

Brush plug-in architecture. 
 (brush is an object that must implement stroke start, move, end events, and optionally size change, color change, opacity change)

Provides a png or jpeg export function that converts canvas image data into base64 encoded string to be submitted with a form.


Flexibly create your own UI for selecting brushes, colors, size etc and just hook into jsCanvasPaint methods for calling brush methods.

$.jsCanvasPaint.setCurrentBrush(marker);
$.jsCanvasPaint.currentBrush.setColor('#FFFFFF'); //if marker defines a setColor method

Callbacks for tying in extra functionality:

$.jsCanvasPaint.strokeCount == 1

//good for creating a window unload listener so that you can warn that data will be lost if form is not saved, but only if
//drawing has started.

$.jsCanvasPaint.afterStroke(function() { ... do something after every brush stroke, like save Stroke Data for playback ...});
